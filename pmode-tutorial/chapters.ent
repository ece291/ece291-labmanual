     Creates entities for each chapter in the tutorial.  Each entity is named
     chap.foo, where foo is the value of the id attribute on that chapter, and
     corresponds to the name of the directory in which that chapter's .sgml
     file is stored.

     Chapters should be listed in the order in which they are referenced.
