 <para>The contents of this manual are a compilation of various
  references, guides, and tutorials taken from many sources and
  written by several independent authors, collectively referred to as
  "The ECE 291 Documentation Project."  The text is authored in SGML
  according to the DocBook DTD and is formatted from SGML into many
  different presentation formats using OpenJade, an open source DSSSL
  engine.  Norm Walsh's DSSSL stylesheets were used with an additional
  customization layer to provide the presentation instructions for
  OpenJade.  The printed version was produced using the PDF
  capabilities of JadeTeX.</para>
