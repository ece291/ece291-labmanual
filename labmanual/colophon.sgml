  <para>Indeed this list is not extensive, as some of the material
  comes from authors unknown at the time of printing of this manual.
  It is hoped that those individuals who have not been mentioned but
  have contributed will feel equally appreciated as those listed
  above.</para>

  <para>The text is authored in SGML according to the DocBook DTD and
  is formatted from SGML into many different presentation formats
  using <application>OpenJade</application>, an open source DSSSL
  engine. Norm Walsh's DSSSL stylesheets were used with an additional
  customization layer to provide the presentation instructions for
  <application>OpenJade</application>.  The printed version of this
  manual would not be possible without Donald Knuth's
  <application>TeX</application> typesetting language, Leslie
  Lamport's <application>LaTeX</application>, or Sebastian Rahtz's
  <application>JadeTeX</application> macro package.  The Makefile
  build system and customized DSSSL stylesheets used for this manual
  were heavily based on the ones used by the FreeBSD Documentation
  Project.</para>
